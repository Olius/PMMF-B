\section	{The Kolmogorov Continuity Theorem}

\begin	{theorem}
Let $S$ be a complete metric space.
Let \( X_t \in S \) be a stochastic process indexed by \( t \ge 0 \),
such that $\abs{X_t-X_{t'}}$ is measurable for any $t$,~$t'$~$\ge 0$.
Suppose that
\begin	{equation}
\label	{eq:kolmogorov-continuity}
	\Pr\bigl(\abs{X_t-X_{t'}}^\beta\bigr) \le C\abs{t-t'}^{\alpha+1} \text.
\end	{equation}
Then for any \( \gamma < \alpha/\beta \),
$X_t$ admits a $\gamma$\dashHolder\ modification.
\end	{theorem}

Let \( \mathcal D_n = 2^{-n}\N \cap [0,n) \),
so that \( \mathcal D_\infty = \bigcup_{n \ge 0} \mathcal D_n \)
is the set of dyadic rationals.
Let $A_n$ be the event
\begin	{equation}
\label	{eq:adjacent-holder}
	\text{\( \abs{X_t-X_{t'}} \le C'\abs{t-t'}^\gamma = 2^{-n\gamma}C' \)
	for all adjacent $t$,~$t'$~$\in\mathcal D_n$}
\end	{equation}
where we set \( C' = 1 \) for now.
By Chebyshev's inequality,
\begin	{align*}
	\Pr\bigl( \abs{X_t-X_{t'}}^\beta \ge 2^{-n\gamma\beta} \bigr)
	&\le	\frac {\Pr\bigl( \abs{X_t-X_{t'}}^\beta \bigr)}
		              {2^{-n\gamma\beta}}                     \\
	&\le	\frac {C\abs{t-t'}^{\alpha+1}}
		        {2^{-n\gamma\beta}}                           \\
	&=	2^{n(\gamma\beta - \alpha - 1)} C                     \text.
\end	{align*}
There are $2^n n$ adjacent pairs in~$\mathcal D_n$,
and so \( \Pr(\, A_n \)~fails\( \,) \le 2^{n(\gamma\beta-\alpha)} nC \).
Since \( \gamma\beta - \alpha < 0 \),
the sum~\( \sum_{n \ge 0} \Pr(\, A_n \)~fails$\,)$ is finite,
hence by the Borel--Cantelli lemma
$A_n$ holds for all \( n \ge N \) almost surely.
As \( \bigcup_{n<N} \mathcal D_n \) is finite,
there is $C'$ such that \eqref{eq:adjacent-holder}~holds
for every \( n \ge 0 \).

We now show that $X_t$ is consequently $\gamma$\dashHolder\
in \( t \in \mathcal D_\infty \).
Call the \term{rank}~$r(t)$
the smallest~$n$ such that \( t \in \mathcal D_n \).
We view $\mathcal D_\infty$ as a graph
whose edges are the union of those of the~$\mathcal D_n$.
For any path \( t_0 \to\dots\to t_m \) in~$\mathcal D_\infty$,
define its \term{redundancy} as the number of~$k$
such that \( r(t_{k-1}) \ge r(t_k) \le r(t_{k+1}) \).
Among all such paths of total length \( \abs{t_0-t_m} \),
choose~$T$ with the minimum number of vertices of each rank,
with larger ranks being most significant in the ordering.
Then $T$ must have redundancy~$=0$:
between (or on) any two different points of~$\mathcal D_{n+1}$
lies a point of~$\mathcal D_n$.
Hence there are at most two edges in \( T \cap \mathcal D_n \) for every~$n$,
and no edge has length exceeding \( \abs{t_0-t_m} \).
This is enough to extract the $\gamma$\dashHolder\ property:
\begin	{align*}
	\abs{X_{t_0} - X_{t_m}}
	&\le	\sum_{k<m} \abs{X_{t_k} - X_{t_{k+1}}} \\
	&\le	C'\sum_{k<m} \abs{t_k - t_{k+1}}^\gamma \\
	&\le	2C'\abs{t_0 - t_m}^\gamma \sum_{n \ge 0} 2^{-n\gamma} \\
	&=	\frac{2C'}{1-2^{-\gamma}} \abs{t_0 - t_m}^\gamma \text.
\end	{align*}

We now know $X_t$ is $\gamma$\dashHolder, hence uniformly continuous,
in \( t \in \mathcal D_\infty \).
Therefore it admits a unique uniformly continuous extension~$\bar X_t$
to the closure \( \overline{\mathcal D_\infty} = [0,\infty) \),
which by continuity inherits the \Holder\ property.
Finally, $\bar X_t$ is a modification of~$X_t$:
for \( t_\varepsilon \in \mathcal D_\infty \)
with \( t_\varepsilon \to t \) as \( \varepsilon \to 0 \),
by Fatou's lemma
\begin	{align*}
	\Pr\bigl( \abs{\bar X_t - X_t}^\beta \bigr)
	&\le	\liminf_{\varepsilon \to 0}
		\Pr\bigl( \abs{\bar X_{t_\varepsilon} - X_t}^\beta \bigr) \\
	&\le	\liminf_{\varepsilon \to 0}
		\abs{t_\varepsilon - t}^{\alpha+1} \\
	&=	0 \text.
\end	{align*}
