\section	{Brownian Motion as a Diffusion Process}

Brownian motion is a Markov process
with translation-invariant transition probabilities given at the origin by
\( dp_t = d(B_t) \).
\begin	{itemize}
\item	\( \alpha_r(t)/t = \frac1t\Pr(\abs{B_t}\ge r)
	= \frac{4\pi}{(2\pi)^{d/2}} t^{-1} \int_{r/\!\sqrt t}^{+\infty}
		x^{d-1} \exp(-x^2/2) \,dx
	\to 0 \)
	by l'HÃ´pital's rule.
\item	\( \frac1t \int_{\R^d} x\,dp_t = \frac1t \Pr(B_t) = 0 \).
\item	Write $d$\nobreakdash-dimensional Brownian motion as
	\( B_t = (B^1_t,\dots,B^d_t) \).
	Then
	\begin	{equation*}
		\frac1t \int_{\R^d} x_i x_j \,dp_t
		=	\frac1t \Pr(B^i_t B^j_t)
		=	[i=j] \text.
	\end	{equation*}
\end	{itemize}
Thus Brownian motion is a diffusion process
with generator \( A = \frac12\Lap \) the half-Laplacian over~$\Cont^2_c(\R^d)$.
