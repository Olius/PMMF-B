%TODO Move stuff from the part on BM to here, and generalize.

\begin	{theorem}[strong Markov property]
Let $X_t$ be a stationary continuous (or càdlàg) Markov process,
and $T$ a finite stopping time.
Then \( d(X_{\ge T}\cond X_{\le T}) = d(X_{\ge 0}\cond X_0)_{X_T} \)
pointwise almost surely,
in that for every bounded measurable~$f$,
\[ \text{\( \Pr[f(X_{\ge T})\cond X_{\le T}]
	=  \Pr[f(X_{\ge 0})\cond X_0](X_T) \)
	almost surely.} \]
\end	{theorem}
