	{Borel for compact convergence implies pointwise measurable}

\begin	{theorem}
Let $X,Y$ be second countable spaces,
with $X$ locally compact and $Y$ regular.
Equip the space~$C(X,Y)$ of continuous functions \( X \to Y \)
with the compact-open topology,
and denote by~$\mathcal B$ the induced Borel \salg.
Then \( \mathcal B = \sgen(\, s_x : x \in X \,) \).
\end	{theorem}

\begin	{corollary}
In the space of continuous paths \( I \to S \),
where \( I \subseteq \R \) is an interval and $S$ is separable metric,
the Borel \salg\ induced by the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets
coincides with the product \salg.
\end	{corollary}

\begin	{proof}
Under these hypotheses,
the compact-open topology on~$C(X,Y)$ admits a countable basis
of sets of the form \( R(K,V) = \{\, f(K) \subseteq V \,\} \),
where \( K \subseteq X \) is compact and \( V \subseteq Y \) is open.
It thus suffices to show that \( R(K,V) \in \sgen(\, s_x : x \in X \,) \).
Since $Y$ is regular,
\( V = \bigcup_n V_n = \bigcup_n \overline{V_n} \)
is a countable union of opens whose closures are contained in~$V$.
We can suppose \( V_n \subseteq V_{n+1} \).
Thus \( R(K,V) = \bigcup_n R(K,V_n) = \bigcup_n R(K,\overline{V_n}) \).
Finally, for \( F \subseteq Y \) closed,
\( R(K,F) = R(Q,F) = \bigcap_{q \in Q} R(q,F) \)
where \( Q \subseteq K \) is a countable dense subset.
\end	{proof}
