\subsection	{Brownian Motion}

Let $X_n$ be i.i.d.~variables with mean~$0$ and variance~$1$,
and set \( S_t = \sum_{k<t} X_k = X_1 +\dots+ X_{\floor t} \).
For \( \varrho > 0 \), let \( B^\varrho_t = S_{\varrho t}/\!\sqrt\varrho \).
%The central limit theorem is the statement that as \( n \to \infty \),
%$B^n_1$~is normally distributed with mean~$0$ and variance~$1$.
For fixed~$t$, as \( \varrho \to \infty \)
restricted so that $\varrho t$ takes integer values,
by the central limit theorem
\( B^\varrho_t = \sqrt t S_{\varrho t}/\!\sqrt{\varrho t} \)
tends in distribution to a normal variable with mean~$0$ and variance~$t$.
Since in general \( \varrho t - \floor{\varrho t} \) is bounded,
\[
	\Bigl\lvert \frac {S_{\varrho t}} {\varrho t}
		- \frac {S_{\floor{\varrho t}}} {\floor{\varrho t}}
	\Bigr\rvert
	\to 0 \quad \text{as \(\varrho \to \infty\),}
\] so that
%(by the Portmanteau Lemma with uniformly continuous bounded test functions)
these two random variables are \term{close} in probability,
and therefore must share any limit in distribution.
%TODO Clarify and justify with LÃ©vy?
Thus as \( \varrho \to \infty \),
the variable~$B^\varrho_t$ is asymptotically normal,
with mean~$0$ and variance~$t$.

Now consider for \( s < t \) the increment
\( B^\varrho_t - B^\varrho_s =
	\sum_{\varrho s \le k < \varrho t} X_k/\!\sqrt\varrho \).
This is independent of~$B^\varrho_r$ if \( r < s \)
because the~$X_n$ are independent,
and since they are also identically distributed
its distribution depends only on the number~$n_\varrho$ of~$X_k$ in the sum.
But \( \abs{B^\varrho_{t-s} - \sum_{k<n_\varrho} X_k/\!\sqrt\varrho}
	< \abs{X_{n_\varrho}}/\!\sqrt\varrho \to 0 \)
in probability,
hence \( B^\varrho_t - B^\varrho_s \) is close to~$B^\varrho_{t-s}$
in probability so in distribution,
and the latter is asymptotically normal.

Finally, any bounded measurable function
\( f(B^\varrho_{t_1},\dots,B^\varrho_{t_n}) \)
can be expressed as a function of the increments
\( \Delta_k B^\varrho_t = B^\varrho_{t_{k+1}} - B^\varrho_{t_k} \)
as \[
	f(B^\varrho_{t_0}+\Delta_0 B^\varrho_t, \dots,
		B^\varrho_{t_{n-1}}+\Delta_{n-1}B^\varrho_t)
	\quad \text{(\( t_0 = 0 \)).}
\]  Therefore the finite-dimensional distributions of~$B^\varrho$
all converge to the distribution with density with respect to the
Lebesgue-measured variables \( x_k \in \R \) given by \[
	\prod_{k<n} \frac {\exp(-\abs{\Delta_k x}^2/2\abs{\Delta_k t})}
		                     {\sqrt{2\pi\abs{\Delta_k t}}}
	\text.
