\begin	{theorem}	[Kolmogorov extension]
Let $S_I$, \( I \in \mathcal I \) be a filtered system of Hausdorff spaces,
with limit~$S$.
Suppose the projections \( s_I \colon S \to S_I \) are surjective.
For each \( I \in \mathcal I \), let $P_I$ be a tight probability measure
on~$S_I$.
If \( s_I^J(P_J) = P_I \) for every \( s_I^J \colon J \to I \) in~$\mathcal I$,
then there exists a unique probability measure~$P$ on~$S$ such that
\( s_I(P) = P_I \) for all \( I \in \mathcal I \).
\end	{theorem}
The proof is an application of the Carath√©odory extension theorem.
Indeed, the product \sig algebra on~$S$ is generated by the~$s_I$,
and surjectivity of the~$s_I$ allows us to define a finitely additive
probability~$P$ on the product algebra generated by the~$s_I$.
The work lies in showing \sig additivity of~$P$.

First note that the product algebra generated by the~$s_I$
admits the simple expression
\( \bigcup_{I \in \mathcal I} \sgen(s_I) \),
due to the system being filtered.
To wit, let \( A_k \subseteq S_{I_k} \) be a finite collection of events.
The~$I_k$ form a finite discrete subcategory of~$\mathcal I$,
which admits a cone \( s_k^0 \colon I_0 \to I_k \).
Then as \( s_{I_k} = s_k^0 s_{I_0} \),
the events \( s_{I_k} \in A_k \) and \( s_{I_0} \in \{s_k^0 \in A_k\} \)
are equivalent.
Hence setting \( A_k^0 = \{s_k^0 \in A_k\} \),
\begin	{equation}
\label	{eq:product-algebra-union}
	\bigcap_k \{s_{I_k} \in A_k\} = \bigcap_k \{s_{I_0} \in A_k^0\}
		\in \sgen(s_{I_0})
		\subseteq \bigcup_{I \in \mathcal I} \sgen(s_I)
	\text.
\end	{equation}
