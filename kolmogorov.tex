\begin	{theorem}	[Kolmogorov extension]
Let \( s_{J \ge I} \colon S_J \to S_I \)
be a projective system of Hausdorff spaces,
with limit~$S$.
Suppose the projections \( s_I \colon S \to S_I \) are surjective.\footnote
	{Note that this obviates the need to consider general
	filtered limits,
	since it would imply that parallel arrows \( J \to I \)
	must be sent to the same function \( S_J \to S_I \).}
For each~$I$, let $P_I$ be a tight probability measure on~$S_I$.
If \( s_{I \le J}(P_J) = P_I \) whenever \( I \le J \),
then there exists a unique probability measure~$P$ on~$S$ such that
\( s_I(P) = P_I \) for all~$I$.
\end	{theorem}
The proof is an application of the Carath√©odory extension theorem.
Indeed, the product \sig algebra on~$S$ is generated by the~$s_I$,
and surjectivity of the~$s_I$ allows us to define a finitely additive
probability on the product algebra generated by the~$s_I$.
The work lies in showing \sig additivity.

First note that the product algebra generated by the~$s_I$
is simply the union
\( \bigcup_I \sgen(s_I) \),
as this union already contains finite conjunctions of its events
due to the system being directed.
To wit, let \( A_k \subseteq S_{I_k} \) be a finite collection of events.
Since the indices are directed there is an \( I_0 \ge I_k \) for all~$k$.
Then as \( s_{I_k} = s_{I_k \le I_0} s_{I_0} \),
\begin	{equation}
\label	{eq:product-algebra-is-union}
	\bigcap_k s_{I_k}^* A_k
		= \bigcap_k s_{I_0}^* s_{I_0 \ge I_k}^* A_k
		= s_{I_0}^* \bigcap_k s_{I_0 \ge I_k}^* A_k
		\in \sgen(s_{I_0})
		\subseteq \bigcup_I \sgen(s_I)
	\text.
\end	{equation}

Now, surjectivity of~$s_I$ implies injectivity of~$s_I^*$.
Therefore the union in~\eqref{eq:product-algebra-is-union}
is a directed union of isomorphic copies of the~$\sgen(P_I)$.
Moreover, by hypothesis \( P_J(s_{J \ge I}^*A_I) = P_I(A_I) \),
so that \( P(s_I^*A_I) = P_I(A_I) \) is a valid definition
of a finitely additive probability~$P$ on the union.
