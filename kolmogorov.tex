\begin	{theorem}	[Kolmogorov extension]
Let $S_I$, \( I \in \mathcal I \) be a filtered system of Hausdorff spaces,
with limit~$S$.
Suppose the projections \( s_I \colon S \to S_I \) are surjective.
For each \( I \in \mathcal I \), let $P_I$ be a tight probability measure
on~$S_I$.
If \( s_I^J(P_J) = P_I \) for every \( s_I^J \colon J \to I \) in~$\mathcal I$,
then there exists a unique probability measure~$P$ on~$S$ such that
\( s_I(P) = P_I \) for all \( I \in \mathcal I \).
\end	{theorem}
The proof is an application of the Carath√©odory extension theorem.
Indeed, the product \sig algebra on~$S$ is generated by the~$s_I$,
and surjectivity of the~$s_I$ allows us to define a finitely additive
probability~$P$ on the algebra
\( \bigcup_{I \in \mathcal I} \sgen(s_I) \).
The work lies in showing \sig additivity of~$P$.
