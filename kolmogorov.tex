\begin	{theorem}	[Kolmogorov extension]
Let \( s_{J \ge I} \colon S_J \to S_I \)
be a projective system of Hausdorff spaces,
with limit~$S$.
Suppose the projections \( s_I \colon S \to S_I \) are surjective.\footnote
	{Note that this obviates the need to consider general
	filtered limits,
	since it would imply that parallel arrows \( J \to I \)
	must be sent to the same function \( S_J \to S_I \).}
For each~$I$, let $P_I$ be a tight probability measure on~$S_I$.
If \( s_{I \le J}(P_J) = P_I \) whenever \( I \le J \),
then there exists a unique probability measure~$P$ on~$S$ such that
\( s_I(P) = P_I \) for all~$I$.
\end	{theorem}
The proof is an application of the Carath√©odory extension theorem.
Indeed, the product \sig algebra on~$S$ is generated by the~$s_I$,
and surjectivity of the~$s_I$ allows us to define a finitely additive
probability on the product algebra generated by the~$s_I$.
The work lies in showing \sig additivity.

First note that the product algebra generated by the~$s_I$
is simply the union
\( \bigcup_I \sgen(s_I) \),
as this union already contains finite conjunctions of its events
due to the system being directed.
To wit, let \( A_k \subseteq S_{I_k} \) be a finite collection of events.
Since the indices are directed there is an \( I_0 \ge I_k \) for all~$k$.
Then as \( s_{I_k} = s_{I_k \le I_0} s_{I_0} \),
the events \( s_{I_k} \in A_k \)
and \( s_{I_0} \in \{s_{I_k \le I_0} \in A_k\} \)
are equivalent, hence
\begin	{equation}
\label	{eq:product-algebra-is-union}
	\bigcap_k \{s_{I_k} \in A_k\}
		= \bigcap_k \{s_{I_0} \in s_{I_k \le I_0}^*(A_k)\}
		\in \sgen(s_{I_0})
		\subseteq \bigcup_I \sgen(s_I)
	\text.
\end	{equation}

Since parallel morphisms in~$\mathcal I$ are equalized by the~$s_I$,
the union on the right in~\eqref{eq:product-algebra-is-union}
is directed by~$\mathcal I$ viewed as directed set in the natural way.
Moreover, surjectivity of the~$s_I$ implies injectivity
of the pullback maps~$s_I^*$ on events.
